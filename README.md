## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Technical Product Manager with a dual passion for building and integrating at the intersection of AI, data engineering, and construction technology.  
With hands-on experience in coding, workflow automation, and bringing together powerhouse tools (Unifier, Primavera, Aconex), I love to architect solutions that create real-world impact.

- 💻 **AI/ML Engineering:** From robust text-to-SQL pipelines to document analysis agents.
- 🔗 **Integration:** Bridging the gap between data, people, and process in construction tech.
- 🏗️ **Product Leadership:** Driving innovation in the construction sector, one workflow at a time.
